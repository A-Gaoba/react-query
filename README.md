# Todo App

## Overview

This Todo App is a modern, interactive web application built using React. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently, with features to add, delete, and filter tasks based on their completion status. The app leverages React hooks for state management and `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management, providing a seamless user experience with optimized data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Edit Todo**: Tasks can be edited directly within the list.
- **Filter Todos**: Tasks can be filtered to show all, active, or completed tasks.
- **Persistent Storage**: Todos are stored on a mock API server, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static type definitions to enhance code quality and understandability.
- **React Query**: Manages server state to synchronize, cache, and update server-side and asynchronous data.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **MockAPI**: Provides a mock API endpoint for storing and managing todos.
